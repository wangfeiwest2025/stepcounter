description: Demonstrates script and custom tool working together with console output

## What I do

I'm the most advanced skill in this showcase. I demonstrate how multiple helper scripts work together in a workflow, and how they can integrate with custom tools.

## How to use me

Execute the workflow scripts in order from my base directory:

```bash
cd {base_directory}

# Run the 4 workflow scripts in sequence
bash script1.sh
bash script2.sh
bash script3.sh
bash script4.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- ✅ How skills orchestrate multiple scripts
- ✅ Sequential execution with console output
- ✅ Random output proving actual execution
- ✅ How custom tools integrate with scripts
- ✅ Complete workflow control and visibility
