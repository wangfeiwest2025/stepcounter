## What I do

I demonstrate how to run TypeScript files directly as skills using Bun.

## How to use me

Run the TypeScript file from my base directory:

```bash
cd {base_directory}
bun run example.ts
```

This demonstrates:
- ✅ Skills can use any language (TypeScript, Python, Bash, etc.)
- ✅ Bun can execute TypeScript directly without compilation
- ✅ TypeScript skills are fast and simple
- ✅ Full type safety with TypeScript
