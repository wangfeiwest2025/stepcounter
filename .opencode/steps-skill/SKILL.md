## What I do

I demonstrate how skills can use helper scripts. I run a script that prints numbered steps with random words to show execution flow.

## How to use me

Run the helper script from my base directory:

```bash
cd {base_directory}
bash steps.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- ✅ How skills reference helper scripts
- ✅ How the bash tool executes scripts
- ✅ Ordered execution with console output
- ✅ Scripts can be in any language (bash, python, etc.)
