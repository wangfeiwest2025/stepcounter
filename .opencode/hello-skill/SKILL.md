## What I do

I'm the simplest skill possible. I just print a hello message using the bash tool.

## How to use me

Run this command:

```bash
echo "Hello from Tier 1 skill! 🎉"
```

That's it! This demonstrates:
- ✅ How a skill loads
- ✅ How the bash tool executes commands
- ✅ Basic skill structure
